# Hi, Here is Ela üçÄ

## Introduction

My name is **Ela**, a very **general** senior high school **student** programmer, I don‚Äôt really like to compete with others, because a life full of competition can easily make me lose my original intention. I just want to pursue a peaceful life that belongs to the programmer, but no one cares about these things. **For the point**, I like **Java** the most! I **always** try to contribute to the **Minecraft plugin community**. I think it will come naturally. All in All, I hope that I can have my **own** stage in the future.
