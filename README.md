# :deciduous_tree: About [@ElaBosak233](https://github.com/ElaBosak233)

Hi, there~ My name is **Ela** `/ˈɛlə/`, and my Chinese name is **埃拉** `/āi lā/`. Meeting you is a *really* lucky thing in my life. ♥

I'm a :sparkling_heart: Chinese, sometimes I'm a girl, or a kitten, or even a pegasus~ I'm quite *capricious*!

And there's something about my **coding philosophy**:

- ⚡ There are no specific rules for doing things, but I am very enthusiastic about **coding**.
- 🍀 I strive for elegance, so I can't bear to look directly at the code I've written before.

I hope to become a *full stack* engineer, even if I find it unrealistic.
